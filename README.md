## Background

### Why:
My partner volunteers to help collect, sort, deliver excess/waste food to food banks in the local area. This food is then either turned into meals or given out to those who need it. One challenge they have found is itâ€™s very hard to find *where* or *who* to contact when thinking of helping.

This is down to things such as there is not one charity organisation, a lot or people of volunteering/not full time etc.

### Idea:
How can we make it easier for people to find their local food banks, but also what they need, and make it as seamless as possible

### Outcome:
I decided this could be an agent that organisations run as an initiative to help their employees help out. The end goal would be to somehow integrate this in to an expenses system to allow companies to directly help out (not in scope of this solution)
